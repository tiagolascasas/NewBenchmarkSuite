# Taskmark

Taskmark (working title) is an ongoing collection of task-heavy applications ideal for heterogeneous CPU and FPGA systems. Besides our main purpose, we also focus on providing very clean source code and compilation instructions, as well as embedded input data (i.e., in header files), so that the code is as easy as possible to analyze and synthesize using HLS tools.
